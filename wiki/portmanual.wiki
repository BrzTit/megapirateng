#summary Manual for porting ArduCopter2 to Arduino MEGA

= Introduction =

ArduCopter2 board looks like the same as Arduino MEGA, except aditional 328p chip


= Add new libraries =
  * APM_RC (we don't have 328 chip on arduino mega, so need new for rc)
  * AP_ADC (we have another IMU board)

= Existing AC2 libraries =

= ArduCopter2 code to MegaPirateNG code =
  * define.h
  * Logging (we don't have flas)
  * Serial (we use Serial2 for GPS)
  * Sonar (we user another sonar)
  * System.pde
  * Setup.pde (we need some additional code for CLI parameters set)
  * etc
